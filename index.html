                    Moon in Aquarius - Your relationship with your emotions can be complicated. You want to free yourself from negative emotions such as fear, anger and jealousy, but it can lead to the fact that others will expect you to be incredibly tolerant when they display such emotions. You may have the tendency to create the greatest possible distance from your natural instincts and emotions, but the situation in which you unconsciously get yourself into forces you to accept the reality. You have the ability to be an impartial observer of life, and this gives you the ability to be a good psychologist who can give other people useful and impartial advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In relationships you tend to attract indifferent, unpredictable or unrivaled partners. It is important for you that there is friendship between you and your lover. You have a strong need for freedom of expression, and this can cause moodiness and unpredictability. You are happy in the company of other people. When you are in a group of people, it is easier for you to understand your feelings and get rid of the fear of intimate situations.
